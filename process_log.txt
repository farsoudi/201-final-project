Received this error:
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
Check the render method of FavoritesPage.
▶ 19 stack frames were collapsed.
This screen is visible only in development. It will not appear if the app crashes in production.
Open your browser’s developer console to further inspect this error. Click the 'X' or hit ESC to dismiss this message.

Fixes:
I fixed the issue with another prompt seen later.

Explanation:
It was important to fix this issue in order to improve robustness and the user experience. Without this change, the page would crash everytime a user tries to view their favorite study spots. By fixing this issue, the favorites page now works as intended.
